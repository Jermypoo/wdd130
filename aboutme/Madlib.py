story = f"One day, I was walking down the street when I stumbled upon a very {adjective} {animal}. It was wearing a {clothing_item} and carrying a {silly_object}. I couldnâ€™t believe my eyes! The {animal} looked at me and said, \"{exclamation}!\" It then started to {verb1} in circles while making {silly_noise} sounds. I was so confused, I had to IMMMEDIETLY {verb2} to escape obviously. But just then, the {animal} began to {verb3}. Thankfully, I finally {verb4} just in time to avoid a {silly_object} being thrown at my face. I must go to bed!"
