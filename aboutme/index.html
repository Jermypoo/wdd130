    <h2>Jerm</h2>
    <p>Hi I am Jarrett or as my friends call me, Jerm. I am studying a BS in Cyber Security
        I love playing video games and going out in nature to explore.</p>
    <p>I have played League of Legends since I was 11 years old and I am still going strong. I work at the old
        Taco Bell to get through school right now, and I don't hate it.</p>
     <p>I wanna be able to create the life style I want and do something relavent today to help people, and 
        feel real smart while I am doing it. I have an amazing girlfriend I have been with
        her for 10 months, her name is Kayla, she is my rock. I wanna have a good life
        with her so I wanna work hard.</p>
     <p>I have been a memeber my whole Life and the church has always been a strong foundation
            in the community where I grew up. I love the classic valley of the shadow of death quote(pslams 23:4).
         I really love computers and I am very excited to increase my education in the computer science feild.</p>
